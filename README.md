# Remote_Sensing_land_cover_map_creation

This is the code I'm creating for my minor research thesis on land cover map creation.

My supervisors are Dr Charlotte Pelletier and Dr Fran√ßois Petitjean and my research topic is "Classification of high-resolution Landsat-8 times series by using lower resolution reference data." My project entails outlier detection, image processing, supervised machine learning and time series forecasting. The reason I choose this topic is it has application in better agriculture management on which I wish to start an AgriTech company someday.

The objective of this project is to create a high-resolution accurate map of Victoria's vegetation, using the latest generation Landsat-8 satellites at 30-meter resolution. This would serve as the basis for fire-spread models, algae outbreak detection or pollution management. The challenge is to use reference map which is at a lower resolution, where each pixel represents the area of 250m x 250m. Furthermore, this reference map contains many mislabelling errors and unclear pixels that need to be rectified. Consequently, this data set is used to accurately classifying our high-resolution satellite image at 30m spatial resolution.
